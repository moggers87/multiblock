Multiblock
==========

.. inclusion-marker-do-not-remove-start

What?
-----

Sync block and mute lists over multiple Mastodon accounts.

Where?
------

- Download: https://pypi.org/project/multiblock/
- Source: https://github.com/moggers87/multiblock
- Docs: https://multiblock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

License?
--------

GPLv3 or later. See LICENSE for the actual text.

Why though?
-----------

I have so many accounts and so do many of the people I'd rather not see on my
timeline. Keeping each account up to date manually is hard work that'd I'd
rather not do.

Can I use this to share my block list with others?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No, Multiblock requires read/write access to each account it's linked to and
syncs bidirectionally. That means their changes propagate to your account and
your changes propagate back to them. In Multiblock every account is equal in
authority.

What's the status of this project?
----------------------------------

We're just getting started.

Contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I'm always looking for contributions, whether they be bug reports, bug fixes,
feature requests, new features, or documentation. Also, feel free to open issues
for support requests too - these are very helpful in showing me where
documentation is required or needs improving.
